       <p> The Gettysburg Address </p>

       <p> Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent, a new nation, conceived in <span id = "liberty"> _________
</span>, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
</p>

       <p> Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a
great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that
field, as a final resting place for <span id = "theyGave">
______________________________ </span> that that nation might live. It is
altogether fitting
 and proper that we should do this. </p>

       <p> But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not consecrate-we
can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled
here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The
world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but <span
id="neverForget"> __________________ </span> what they did here. It is for us
the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they
who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be
here dedicated to the great task remaining before us-that from these honored
dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last
full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve that these dead shall
not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of
freedom-and that government of the people, by the people, for the people,
shall not perish from the earth. </p>
